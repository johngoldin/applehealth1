# For example, flight to Paris on 2014-10-08 leaves at
# 20:45 NY time, duration of flight is 6 hours 40 minutes. Therefore
# arrival is scheduled as 03:25 the next morning NY time which is
# 09:25 Paris time. 09:25 Paris time is  07:25 UTC.
# If Export times are all converted from UTC to
# eastern time, then the plane's arrival would appear to be
# 03:25 (same as above). So if I see a time in the data that
# is after 03:25 and (before the return to New York) it needs
# to be adjusted to local Paris time rather than to New York time.

# I will be applying this function to nearly a million times so it's important
# that it be vectorized and compiled. Vectorized is what really counts.

  # with_tz is the key lubridate function that I am relying on. Handles daylight savings as well.

  tz(local) <- "UTC"    # treat everything as if it were UTC, even if it isn't, because the whole vector has to be one arbitrary time zone when I bind rows together
  # Although the vector is marked as UTC, I will treat the hour as being whatever the local
